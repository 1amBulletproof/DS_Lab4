# DS_Lab4
This is the DS 202 JHU lab 4 code

Lab4.java is the main file. This program will sort a given input file using both
shell sort and heap sort and output the resulting time and array to a file.

to run the program compile Lab4.java

run Lab4.class. It is expecting an input file and an output file for parameters

i.e."java Lab4 input.txt output.txt"


**Alternative**

I have included a shell script "Lab4ShellScript.bash"
to run all input and output scenarios. You may need to edit this file: 
line 2 refers to the project directory: make sure your directory matches
